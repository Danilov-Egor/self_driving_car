<H3>Behavioral cloning project</H3>

<H5>Overview</H5>  
The objective of this project is to clone human driving behavior using a Deep Neural Network. In order to achieve this, we are going to use a simple Car Simulator. During the training phase, we navigate our car inside the simulator using the keyboard. While we navigating the car the simulator records training images and respective steering angles. Then we use those recorded data to train our neural network.

The idea of this project is to clone human's behavior on the road. First we have to ride several laps and to collect data: images that are made with camera mounted on a bonnet and steering angle. Than the CNN will have to predict the steering angle of the car.
